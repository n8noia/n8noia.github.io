      <h2>Race: I didn't choose this life. Oh wait, yes I did.</h2>

      <p>DND has several customizable races with their own lore and stereotypes that can help you decide what kind of character you want to make. Each race comes with bonuses and penalties that help shape your character. Races also have various subraces, such as the mountain dwarf, that have additional benefits. Some races lean heavily towards specific classes, so it's important to know what class you want to make beforehand. Overall, it's great to choose a race to learn their culture, tendencies, and affiliations.
      </p>

      <h2>Character Sheet Check!</h2>

      <p>In this page, you will fill out your <span class="emph">walking speed, age,</span> and <span class="emph">size.</span> If you have any special features, such as the Goliath's Stone's Endurance, go ahead and put that in the <span class="emph">Features and Traits</span> section indicated below. Take note of any <span class="emph">ability score </span>increases for the future (e.g. "Your Constitution score increases by 2").

      <h2>Important Information About Your Race</h2>
      <p> Your race has tons of useful material when you need help developing a backstory for your character. While the ability scores are important to raise in order to min/max, the true value of your race comes from the rich and long history that is tied with that species. If you are a big reader, researching the different races and their history will do wonders for enriching your backstory and roleplaying.</p>

      <h2>Too long didn't read... </h2>
      <p>If you aren't a reader, you will be pleased to know that the things you need to write down are put in one easy to read section! All of the noteworthy features and bonuses from your race is under the section titled <span class="emph">"(your race) Traits."</span> If you wish to min/max your character, choose your race after you have rolled your <a  href="Abilities.html">ability scores</a> and picked a <a href="Class.html">class.</a> Your class will determine what ability scores you wish to max out. Make sure to read the subspecies as well, as different subspecies have different bonuses.</p>
