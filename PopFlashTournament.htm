		<h1>Last Tournament in Ignition Series Creates a New Storyline</h1>
			<p>
				As a finale to the <em>Ignition Series</em>, the <em>Pop Flash tournament</em> had everything you could possibly imagine in a tournament. 8 of the top <em>VALORANT</em> teams met in an all 
				out brawl for the crown and in the process one team became the definitive top <em>VALORANT</em> team. Besides one major rivalry, there were several other
				storylines coming into this tournament, and more storylines were created within the <em>VALORANT</em> scene. New rivalries were made, teams fell from grace, and rookies became superstars. 
				Every team had something to prove, all except for one small team who had recently found a new home.

			<h3>TSM vs Dignitas</h3>
				<p>
					As the current first seed with a win from the <em>Faze Invitational</em>, <b>TSM</b> was looking as strong as ever with their star OP'er, Matthew <i>"Wardell"</i> Yu. Their 
					only competitors were the second seed <b>Sentinels</b>, who were anxious to get their revenge. At least, that's what everyone thought. Little did they know they 
					would be driven into a corner by a team who was homeless a couple weeks ago. The newly signed <b>Dignitas</b> was a team who had yet to see any sort of success 
					within the ignition series. Their team was led by Harrison <i>"Psalm"</i> Cheng, a superstar who is no stranger to the pro scene. <i>Psalm</i> has seen success in multiple
					games, such as Starcraft, DOTA 2, Heroes of the Storm, and most recently, Fortnite. Their last member was a last minute addition to the roster, a 
					wild card by the name of Ryan <i>"Shanks"</i> Ngo. Shanks was the last piece of the <b>Dignitas</b> roster for the <em>Pop Flash invitational</em>, and a vital piece at that.

			<h3>Fortune Favors the Prepared</h3>

				<p>
					Right from the start <b>Dignitas</b> showed that they were a team to be reckoned with. After losing the pistol and subsequent eco round, <b>Dignitas</b> buckled down with their
					rifles and defended the <b>TSM</b> onslaught for 8 straight rounds, leaving TSM and viewers baffled. It seemed that <b>Dignitas</b> knew <b>TSM</b> would pick Haven and learned precisely
					what they did and simply countered their attacking strategies. With an 8-4 score line before the two teams switched, <b>Dignitas</b> was looking like everything but the bottom seed of
					this tournament. 
				</p>
				<p>
					On the defending side, <i>Wardell</i> was not happy and frankly annoyed with the outcome of the half, as one newbie challenged him at every corner. <i>Shanks</i> was a constant thorn in 
					<i>Wardell's</i> side. Once they both acquired enough money to buy Operators, it became a guessing game of which angle <i>Wardell</i> was holding. The battle was back and forth, but ultimately 
					<i>Wardell</i> and the rest of <b>TSM</b> managed to bring the match to overtime. Their victory didn't last long however as <b>Dignitas</b> won both overtime rounds, taking the first game against the defending champions.
